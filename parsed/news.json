        "description": "The Murena project provides an Android-based, mobile operating system which strives to replace Google proprietary apps with open source alternatives along with a range of privacy protecting features. The project's latest release, version 1.20, improves third-party application support, enforces more strict rules on privacy ratings for third-party apps, and improves the tracker manager page. 'We embedded some improvements! PDF reader:  PDF Viewer Plus has been replaced by MJ PDF reader to provide more options and up to date security patches. Updater: Update's download is resumed automatically when needed. Third Party Apps support: /e/OS is now compatible with the Application Licensing API. Some third party apps can check the licensing status to make sure that the user is allowed to use the application, for instance in case of paid applications. Third party apps which are using this API are now working properly on /e/OS. We fixed the partial support of the On Demand Modules API used by third party apps to download split APKs at runtime. Advanced Privacy: You can now realize easily how efficiently Advanced Privacy protects you against trackers in the widget and on the home page. The design of the tracker management page is now more efficient. The Privacy Score has been forced to 0 for a list of apps for which Terms of Services clearly don't respect your privacy and your data.' Additional features and bug fixes are outlined in the project's release notes. A list of supported devices and download options can be found in Murena's documentation.",
