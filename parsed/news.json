        "description": "The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails) is a Debian-based live DVD/USB with the goal of providing complete Internet anonymity for the user. The project's latest release, version 6.0, places a focus on accessing storage and protecting the user from malicious storage devices. 'Tails 6.0 warns you about errors when reading or writing from your Tails USB stick. These alerts can help you diagnose hardware failures on your USB stick and backup your Persistent Storage before it's too late. Mount external devices automatically - When you plug in an external storage device, a USB stick or an external hard disk, Tails 6.0 mounts it automatically. If the storage device contains an encrypted partition, Tails 6.0 offers you to unlock the encryption automatically. This feature also simplifies how to unlock VeraCrypt encrypted volumes. Protection against malicious USB devices - If an attacker manages to plug a malicious USB device in your computer, they could run software that breaks the security built in Tails without your knowledge. To protect from such attacks while you are away from your computer, Tails 6.0 ignores any USB device that is plugged in while your screen is locked.' These and additional features are covered in the project's release announcement. Download: tails-amd64-6.0.img (1,359MB, signature, torrent, pkglist).",
