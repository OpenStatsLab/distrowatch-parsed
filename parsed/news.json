The new update, 20.04 OTA-4 adjusts notification behaviour, makes it possible to assign each contact their own ringtone, and makes it easier to switch themes: 'We have always had a system-wide dark mode in the system. However, in the past, you had to use a third-party app to access the necessary switch. In this OTA, we've added a new toggle switch in the System Settings to allow you to change it without the need of an additional app. To access it, go to System Settings > Background & Appearance. For now, it will affect applications only, and not the other system components (such as notifications). Also, you'll have to restart the applications for the change to take effect. In the future, we plan to extend this system to also affect system components, and to have the change applied immediately too.' Additional details can be found in the project's release announcement.
