        "description": "Dynebolic was a member of the Debian family which was intended to serve the needs of media activists, artists and creative individuals, a practical tool for multimedia production. The project has been dormant for about ten years, but has become active once more. The project has published a development snapshot (based on Devuan) for the upcoming 4.0.0 release. The new release is a live image only, without the ability to install it on an internal disk and without any package management tools. 'Ten years have passed and today we are back with a brand new Dynebolic 4.0 based on Devuan 5 'Daedalus', live-boot and the Linux kernel 6.8 series. We introduce a new user experience organized as different journeys into creativity, that we call workflows. Our desktop adopts KDE 5 Plasma and its Activities to provide pre-sets for five specific workflows: streaming, audio, video, graphics, publishing. Each activity is easily reached from the desktop panel or via keyboard shortcuts and offers everything needed for each workflow, while excluding the noise of other workflows, without compromising on access. If you are working, for example, in the Graphic workflow, nothing is stooping you from starting an app that pertains to, say, the Video workflow. Activities are easily customizable by the user in the system settings.' Additional details can be found in the release announcement. Download: dynebolic-4.0.0-beta.iso (1,516MB, SHA512, signature).",
