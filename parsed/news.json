        "description": "Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is an enterprise-class distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux. The project has published an update to its 5.0 series which introduces blocklists for the Univention Directory Manager. 'A new feature in UCS is \u201cblocklists\u201d for the Univention Directory Manager (UDM). This feature allows UDM to block previously used values for specific attributes. One possible use case would be preventing the unintentional reuse of an email address, which could potentially lead to one user accessing another user\u2019s emails: a user had the email address \u201csmith@company.com,\u201d then leaves the company, and their account is deleted. Shortly after, a new user \u201csmith\u201d is created. Now, UDM can prevent the creation because \u201csmith@company.com\u201d would be used as the email address again. Blocking old email addresses occurs automatically when the feature is activated (it is initially deactivated) and the corresponding blocklists are created. The blocklists can also be managed with a UMC module.' Additional information can be found in the distribution's release announcement and in the release notes. Download: UCS_5.0-7-amd64.iso (966MB, SHA512, signature, pkglist).",
