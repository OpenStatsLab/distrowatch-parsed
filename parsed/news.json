The latest development snapshot features several other changes, including a new approach to handling atomic updates: 'ABRoot, our implementation of A/B Partitioning, facilitates updates in an immutable system through atomic transactions between two partitions, ensuring a consistently functioning system. In Vanilla OS 2 Orchid, we introduced ABRoot v2, a complete rewrite of the project designed to be more reliable and faster. Transactions now occur through OCI image expansion instead of applying package updates, ensuring the system receives an exact copy of the tested image. ABRoot v2 brings additional features, such as the ability to dump the system state for support in case of issues, switching between flavors without data loss by changing the base image, auto-recovery of the ABRoot file system structure, and more.' Additional details can be found in the project's release announcement. The new beta release (pkglist) is linked on the distribution's download page and requires a GitHub account to access.",
