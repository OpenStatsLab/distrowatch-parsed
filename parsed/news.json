        "description": "ALT Linux is a project which produces multiple editions of an independent distribution for Russian speakers. The project's latest release, version 10.2, enables installing the distribution to Btrfs pools, includes Timeshift for working with filesystem snapshots, and includes an OEM install mode. 'Computer manufacturers will be interested in the preinstallation mode (OEM mode). Added Timeshift 23.12. This program is designed to create snapshots of system files and settings. In the installer, at the disk preparation stage, it became possible to create subpartitions of the BtrFS. This file system uses accelerated operations with any files thanks to copy-on-write technology which  affects fault tolerance and ease of administration. A security benefit when using BtrFS is the creation of a restore point before updating the system. A module has been added to the System Control Center (Alterator) for remote configuration of the system via the alterator-fbi network (Form Based Interface) which provides a web-based management interface. Changes have been made to the text of the license agreement.' Additional details can be found in the project's release announcement. Download: alt-workstation-10.2-x86_64.iso (6,812MB), alt-server-10.2-x86_64.iso (4,955MB).",
