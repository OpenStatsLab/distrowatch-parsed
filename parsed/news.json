The project's latest release, OpenMediaVault 7.0, is based on Debian 12 introduces new notification and monitoring tools to make managing the NAS more efficient. 'The changelog will list all improvements in this version alongside the following: Upgrade to Debian 12 (Bookworm). Package updates and notification will be handled by unattended-upgrades. Relocate Linux MD device (Software RAID) management into a separate plugin. Add support for network ethernet devices using device tree aliases, e.g. endX. Replace the cron-apt package with unattended-upgrades and apticron. The former ensures that security updates are installed automatically, and the latter ensures that notifications are sent when new package updates are available. The apt-listchanges package will send you an email with a summary of the latest changes whenever packages are upgraded. Add the ability to authenticate an RPC call by using the X-OPENMEDIAVAULT-SESSIONID header instead of a cookie. The session ID is returned with the response of the Session::login RPC. Reduce the query time when determining the SMART information by reducing the query parameters to the minimum. Add a dashboard widget to display the temperatures of all physical disks.'
