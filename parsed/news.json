        "description": "Franco Conidi has announced the release of SysLinuxOS 12.3, an updated version of the project's Debian-based distribution designed primarily for system integrators and administrators. This version is based on Debian 12 and comes with a long-term supported 6.5 version of the Linux kernel. 'SysLinuxOS is updated to version 12.3. In this version, numerous bugs have been fixed and it also brings with it several improvements to make it much more intuitive and easy to use. Many changes are under the hood, while others are purely aesthetic, and they improve the menu and icons in both GNOME and MATE desktop environments. SysLinuxOS is a distribution for system integrators and network administrators, it must be chameleonic and therefore have tools that help to interface in a mixed Windows/Linux environment. In this update, I have excluded two or three programs in favor of others that I believe are more useful for greater interoperability. I have therefore added WoeUSB, Teams for Linux, Webex, Github Desktop, Wiregui, Timeshift. As you can easily imagine, there is a lot of work behind this, so I apologize in advance if you encounter any small problems.'
