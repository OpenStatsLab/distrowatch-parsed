Its version 240313 features the brand-new KDE Plasma 6 desktop with Qt 6 and the Wayland display server by default: 'This is our third release in 2024 and brings quite big changes. We are dropping our GNOME ISO image due to a lack of maintenance and double testing for every release. Also, this should avoid confusion among users about the net-installation, and supported desktop environments, since we are providing most desktop environments directly in the netinstall. This ISO image is based on Plasma 6 and will also have Wayland enabled by default. This should not have a big impact on NVIDIA users since X11 can still be used after the installation. Plasma 6 seems Wayland-wise in really good shape and as soon wayland-protocols and NVIDIA provide the explicit sync protocol, this should also be the case for most NVIDIA users. Features: Plasma 6 is now shipped in the ISO image and uses Wayland as default, GNOME ISO image got dropped to avoid confusion about netinstall; Calamares - rebased for Qt 6; refind - add f2fs and zfs as option including luks2 encryption....'
